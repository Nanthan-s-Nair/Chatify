# Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive music recommendation and control system. It leverages Spotify's Web API and OpenAI's GPT-4 model to deliver a highly personalized and interactive music experience.

Mood-based recommendations and automatic playlist creation are just a command away! This project serves as a fun example of how APIs, machine learning models, and natural language processing can be combined to create useful applications.
